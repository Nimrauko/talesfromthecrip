# Transcription of Rabbi Tanya Ruttenberg
## What will it take?

You know why the principle of redeeming hostages is so critical in the Jewish world? Because the Romans would just leave people to become enslaved- ah, too bad for you - and our Rabbis understood the concept of *collective responsibility*. 

Because *pikuach nefesh* - saving lives- is one of the greatest principles in our entire corpus. (Yes, there should have been an "all for all" deal in October, for so, so, so many reasons.)

Maimonides, our great 12th c. scholar, wrote: 

>"Captivity is in the same category as famine, drought, or exposure, and one stands in danger to one's life."

Famine. Drought. It's terrible because it <u>risks people's lives.</u>

**BECAUSE WE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO PUT PEOPLES'S LIVES AT RISK.**

Maimonides continues: 
>"Someone who shies away from redeeming a captive violates the following Torah prohibitions, [including] 

> 'Do not stand by when someone's life is in danger' [Leviticus 19:16]

> 'Love your neighbor as yourself' [Leviticus 19:18}

This does not mean that these obligations are only upon us when captives are in play. They are obligatory always. **ALWAYS**

I know where the dehumanization of Palestinians comes from in my community. I see how it happens. The refusal to look. The justifications. The rationalizations. The incuriosity about the reality of Occupation and the inability to engage seriously with the atrocities that have taken place over these last months.

**I want to know how it ends**

There is no bombing and starving another people that will bring security, or a more whole, more healed future. **There is no Torah in this**

Remember who we have been. Remember who we are supposed to be. Please. It will only get worse from here, and it's already too late.
