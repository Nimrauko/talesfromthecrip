### Good Evening Everybody, we are glad to be here and grateful. It's our first movie in so many years. My community, my family, has been filming our community being erased by this brutal occupation. Im here celebrating the award, but it's also very hard for me to celebrate when there are tens of thousands of my people being slaughtered and massacred by Israel in Gaza. Massafer Yatta, my community, is also being erased by Israeli Bulldozers. I ask one thing for Germany, as I am in Berlin here: to respect the UN calls and stop sending weapons to Israel.
