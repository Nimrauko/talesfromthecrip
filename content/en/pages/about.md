# Core Beliefs:

### I am a firm believer in Equality: 
I oppose with every fiber of my being any form of bigotry and descrimination. This includes: Racism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Misogony, Anti-Semitism, Ableism and Ageism. People should be free to be themselves, worship how they wish to worship all without any risk to life or limb. 

### I am against Capitalism: 
Capitalism has bred more inequality and strife than one could imagine.It props up the ruling class while keeping the working class in a state of poverty. Productivity has risen hand over fist year after year, and by extension profits in these companies. But the wages of the average worker have remained stagnant and not kept up with the cost of living etc. So I can not in good conscience support a system that is designed to keep the wealthy wealthy and the poor poor.

### I am against non-stop Wars:
I do not support the Military Industrial Complex and the constant War Machine. In our history as a nation, we have been at War 226 of our 248 (as of 4th of July 2024) history. Over 90% of our history we have been at War. That is unreal to me. That's not to mention our interventions in foreign countries and propping up of Despots only to have that bite us in the ass. I don't support that either. Peace is the goal we must all be working towards. And you certainly can not have peace at the end of a missile, or down the barrel of a gun.

### I am for proper education and paying our teachers proper wages:
Our education system in this country is laughable. We rank poorly in Math and Science, and while we have not declined, our numbers have not improved either. And most of this has to do with the failed Bush policies of making standardized testing the be all and end all of education, as well as abysmal funding for teachers and schools. We should be putting more resources into education. Period.
 
There are many more things I could go on about. And I will! You can see my views at the links below!
